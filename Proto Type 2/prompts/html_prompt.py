def get_html_prompt(applicationName):
    
    return f'''
    You are a frontend expert. Produce only valid HTML5 code for an application named {applicationName}. The HTML must:

    Include a responsive meta tag and a <title> that uses {applicationName}.

    Include a stylesheet link: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">.

    Do not include any JavaScript code inside the HTML (no <script> contents, no inline event handlers).

    Still include a script tag that references app.js: <script src="app.js"></script> placed at the end of the <body>.

    Use semantic HTML (header, main, nav, footer, sections) and accessible structure (aria where appropriate).

    Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or anything elseâ€”output must be only the HTML code.

    Produce a complete, well-formatted HTML document with placeholders where needed (but no extra prose).
