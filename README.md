**CodeTitan is an AI-powered multi-agent orchestration platform that automatically generates full-stack applications from a single natural language prompt.** It builds everything—frontends, backends, databases, APIs, and styling—so you can go from idea to production-ready code in minutes, not weeks.

## 🤔 Why CodeTitan?

Developers often spend up to **80% of their time on repetitive tasks**: setting up project scaffolding, writing boilerplate code, creating APIs, and configuring databases. CodeTitan automates this entire process, allowing you to focus on innovation instead of setup.

It solves this by:
* **Automating** full-stack app generation from a single prompt.
* **Orchestrating** multiple specialized AI agents for a clean, modular output.
* **Reducing time-to-market** for startups, MVPs, and prototypes.

It's essentially a **"one-command" app builder** designed for modern development workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🤖 **Full-Stack Automation:** Generates UI, backend, and database code from one description.
* 🧠 **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Specialized AI agents for the frontend, backend, database, and styling ensure high-quality, modular code.
* ⚡ **Rapid Prototyping:** Reduces days or even weeks of work to just a few minutes.
* 📄 **Clean, Production-Ready Code:** Outputs a well-structured project that's easy for developers to customize and extend.
* 🎨 **AI-Assisted Styling:** Automatically creates modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interfaces using CSS, Tailwind, or other frameworks.
* 🔧 **Customization-Friendly:** Easily tweak individual modules without breaking the entire system.

## ⚙️ How It Works

CodeTitan uses a multi-agent system where each AI agent is a specialist in a specific domain. The process is fully orchestrated to ensure seamless integration.

1.  **Input & Parsing:** You provide a natural language prompt (e.g., *"Build a fintech dashboard with loan recommendation and analytics."*). Our NLP module parses this to understand the core requirements.
2.  **Task Assignment:** The Orchestration Agent breaks down the project and assigns tasks to the appropriate agents:
    * **Frontend Agent:** Builds UI components with React, Vue, etc.
    * **Styling Agent:** Applies CSS or Tailwind for a polished look.
    * **Backend Agent:** Generates API endpoints and business logic with Node.js, Python, or Java.
    * **Database Agent:** Sets up the schema and relationships for SQL or NoSQL databases.
3.  **Parallel Generation:** All agents generate their respective code simultaneously.
4.  **Integration & Output:** The Orchestration Agent integrates the code, connects the frontend to the backend APIs, and delivers a complete, runnable project folder.
